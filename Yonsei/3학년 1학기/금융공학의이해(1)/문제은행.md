1. **On April 1, 2022, a company enters into a forward contract to buy 5 million euros on October 1, 2022. On June 1, 2022, it enters into a forward contract to sell 5 million euros on October 1, 2022. Assuming the first contract is to buy euros at a rate of 1 euro = 1.25 US dollars, and the second contract is to sell euros at a rate of 1 euro = 1.30 US dollars, the total profit would be:**

회사가 2022년 4월 1일에 5백만 유로를 2022년 10월 1일에 구매하기 위한 선물 계약을 체결하고, 2022년 6월 1일에 5백만 유로를 2022년 10월 1일에 판매하기 위한 선물 계약을 체결했습니다. 첫 번째 계약은 1유로당 1.25달러에 유로를 구매하는 것이고, 두 번째 계약은 1유로당 1.30달러에 유로를 판매하는 것입니다.

이 두 계약을 통해 발생하는 총 이익을 계산해 보겠습니다.

1. 첫 번째 계약: 5백만 유로를 1유로당 1.25달러에 구매
   - 지출: 5,000,000 유로 * 1.25 달러/유로 = 6,250,000 달러

2. 두 번째 계약: 5백만 유로를 1유로당 1.30달러에 판매
   - 수입: 5,000,000 유로 * 1.30 달러/유로 = 6,500,000 달러

3. 총 이익 계산:
   - 총 수입: 6,500,000 달러
   - 총 지출: 6,250,000 달러
   - 총 이익: 6,500,000 달러 - 6,250,000 달러 = 250,000 달러

따라서, 이 두 선물 계약을 통해 발생하는 총 이익은 250,000 달러입니다.

2. **Which of the following is a difference between buying a put option and selling a call option?**
1. Buying a put option requires the buyer to deliver the underlying asset, while selling a call option does not require the seller to deliver the underlying asset.
2. **Buying a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset, while selling a call option requires the seller the obligation to sell the underlying asset.**
3. Buying a put option is advantageous when the underlying asset price rises, while selling a call option is advantageous when the underlying asset price falls.
4. There is no correct answer.
5. Buying a put option limits potential losses and selling a call option also limits potential losses.

가장 적절한 답변은 다음과 같습니다:

2. Buying a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset, while selling a call option requires the seller the obligation to sell the underlying asset.

풋 옵션을 매수하는 것은 매수자에게 기초 자산을 특정 가격에 판매할 권리를 주며, 콜 옵션을 매도하는 것은 매도자에게 기초 자산을 특정 가격에 판매할 의무를 부여합니다.

3. **Suppose that a June put option to sell a share for $60 costs $4 and is held until June. Under what circumstances will the seller of the option make a profit?**

1. The seller of the option will never make a profit.
2. **The price of the share is $57 in June.**
3. It depends on whether the seller is in short position or long position
4. The price of the share is $54 in June.

풋 옵션의 매도자(옵션 프리미엄을 받는 사람)는 옵션이 행사되지 않거나, 행사되더라도 프리미엄보다 손실이 적을 때 이익을 볼 수 있습니다. 주어진 상황에서 풋 옵션의 행사가격은 $60이며, 옵션 프리미엄은 $4입니다.

풋 옵션의 매수자는 주가가 행사가격($60) 이하로 떨어질 때 옵션을 행사할 가능성이 높습니다. 따라서 매도자가 이익을 보려면 주가가 $60 이상이거나, 주가가 $60 이하로 떨어지더라도 손실이 옵션 프리미엄을 초과하지 않아야 합니다.

1. 주가가 $60 이상일 때: 매수자는 옵션을 행사하지 않기 때문에 매도자는 프리미엄 $4를 그대로 이익으로 가져갑니다.
2. 주가가 $60 이하일 때: 매도자는 주식을 $60에 사서 시장가에 팔아야 하기 때문에 손실을 보게 됩니다. 그러나 이 손실이 프리미엄 $4를 초과하지 않으면 매도자는 여전히 이익을 볼 수 있습니다.

따라서 각 선택지를 검토해보면:

1. The seller of the option will never make a profit.
   - 틀림. 주가가 $60 이상일 경우 매도자는 프리미엄 $4를 이익으로 가져갑니다.

2. The price of the share is $57 in June.
   - 손실 계산: $60 - $57 = $3 (손실)
   - 프리미엄 $4를 받았으므로, 순이익 = $4 - $3 = $1 (이익)

3. It depends on whether the seller is in short position or long position.
   - 옵션 매도자는 포지션과 상관없이 프리미엄을 받습니다. 이 문장은 관련이 없습니다.

4. The price of the share is $54 in June.
   - 손실 계산: $60 - $54 = $6 (손실)
   - 프리미엄 $4를 받았으므로, 순손실 = $6 - $4 = $2 (손실)

따라서, 매도자가 이익을 보는 경우는 선택지 2번입니다. 주가가 $57일 때, 매도자는 프리미엄을 고려하여 이익을 볼 수 있습니다.

4. **A trader sells a put option with a strike price of $40 for $5. What is the trader’s maximum loss?**

1. 40

2. **35**

3. Unlimited

4. 5

풋 옵션 매도자의 최대 손실을 계산하기 위해서는 기초 자산 가격이 최저 어디까지 내려갈 수 있는지를 고려해야 합니다. 풋 옵션의 경우 기초 자산의 가격이 0까지 내려갈 수 있으므로, 가장 큰 손실은 기초 자산의 가격이 0이 될 때 발생합니다.

주어진 풋 옵션의 행사가격은 $40이고, 옵션 프리미엄은 $5입니다. 따라서 풋 옵션 매도자의 최대 손실은 다음과 같이 계산됩니다:

1. 기초 자산 가격이 0이 되었을 때 매도자는 $40에 해당 주식을 매수해야 합니다.
2. 따라서 $40의 손실이 발생합니다.
3. 그러나 매도자는 초기 프리미엄 $5를 받았으므로, 총 손실은 $40 - $5 = $35입니다.

따라서, 풋 옵션 매도자의 최대 손실은 $35입니다. 정답은 2번입니다.

5. **Suppose an investor holds 5,000 shares of a stock worth $25 each and purchases put options for 5,000 shares at $1 each. If the stock price falls to $20, which of the following accurately describes the profit or loss with and without the put options? Ignore the time value of the money.**
1. **Without the put options, the loss is $25,000 and with the put options, the loss decreases to $5,000.**
2. Without the put options, the loss is $25,000 and with the put options, the loss decreases to $20,000.
3. Without the put options, the loss is $5,000 and with the put options, the loss decreases to $5,000.
4. Without the put options, the loss is $5,000 and with the put options, the loss increases to $20,000.

먼저 주식의 가치 하락으로 인한 손실을 계산해봅시다. 투자자는 주당 $25에 5,000주를 보유하고 있으며, 주가가 $20로 떨어졌습니다.

1. **옵션이 없는 경우의 손실**:
   - 주당 손실: $25 - $20 = $5
   - 총 손실: $5 * 5,000주 = $25,000

2. **옵션을 사용한 경우**:
   - 풋 옵션을 구매하는 데 든 비용: $1 * 5,000주 = $5,000
   - 주가가 $20로 떨어졌을 때, 풋 옵션은 주당 $5 ($25 - $20)의 가치가 있습니다. 이는 주당 손실을 상쇄합니다. 그러나 옵션 구매 비용을 고려해야 합니다.
   - 옵션을 실행하여 주당 $25에 주식을 팔 수 있으므로, 주식 가치 하락으로 인한 손실이 없습니다. 그러나 옵션 구매 비용 $5,000는 여전히 손실입니다.
   - 따라서 옵션을 사용할 경우의 순손실: $5,000

**정리하면**, 옵션이 없는 경우 손실은 $25,000이고, 옵션을 사용한 경우 손실은 옵션 구매 비용인 $5,000입니다.

따라서 정답은:
1. Without the put options, the loss is $25,000 and with the put options, the loss decreases to $5,000.

6. **Which of the following strategies provides portfolio insurance?**
1. **Owning stocks and buying put options**
2. Owning stocks and selling call options
3. Owning stocks and selling put options
4. Owning stocks and buying call options

포트폴리오 보험을 제공하는 전략은 다음과 같습니다:

1. Owning stocks and buying put options

즉, 주식을 소유하고 풋 옵션을 매입하는 것입니다. 이 전략은 주식 가격이 하락할 경우 손실을 제한할 수 있기 때문에 포트폴리오 보험으로 사용됩니다.

7. **Suppose that a March call option to buy a share for $50 costs $2.50 and is held until March. Which of the following conditions must be met for the holder of the option to make a profit and for the option to be exercised?**
1. The market price of the share is greater than $50
2. **The market price of the share is greater than $52.50**
3. The market price of the share is less than $52.50
4. The market price of the share is less than $50
2. 시장 가격이 $52.50보다 높아야 합니다.

설명:
- 콜 옵션의 행사 가격은 $50이고, 옵션의 비용은 $2.50입니다.
- 옵션을 이익으로 만들기 위해서는, 주식의 시장 가격이 행사 가격과 옵션의 비용을 합친 $52.50보다 높아야 합니다.
- 이 경우에만 옵션을 행사하여 주식을 $50에 구입하고 시장 가격보다 높게 팔아 이익을 낼 수 있습니다.

8. **It is August, and a trader writes a December call option with a strike price of $15. The option price is $2.50. Describe the trader's net payoff if the stock price is $18 in December. Ignore the time value of money.**
1. -2.5
2. **-0.5**
3. 2.5

옵션 작성자의 순 손익을 계산하기 위해서는, 주식 가격이 행사 가격을 초과하는 경우 옵션이 행사될 때 발생하는 손익을 고려해야 합니다.

1. 옵션 프리미엄: 옵션 작성자는 옵션을 작성함으로써 $2.50의 프리미엄을 받습니다.
2. 주식 가격: 주식 가격이 $18로 상승하면, 옵션 보유자는 $15의 행사 가격으로 주식을 살 수 있습니다.
3. 순 손익 계산:
   - 옵션 작성자는 $15의 가격으로 주식을 팔아야 하므로, $18 - $15 = $3의 손실이 발생합니다.
   - 하지만, 초기 프리미엄 $2.50를 받았으므로, 최종 손실은 $3 - $2.50 = $0.50입니다.

따라서, 옵션 작성자의 순 손익은 -$0.50입니다. 정답은 2번입니다.

9. **You would like to speculate on a rise in the price of a certain stock in three months. The current stock price is $29, and a 3-month call with a strike price of $30 costs $2.90. You have $5,800 to invest.**
1. Call options have lower potential profit than stocks, but also have smaller potential loss.
2. **Call options have greater potential profit than stocks, but also have greater potential loss.**
3. Call options have a greater potential profit and smaller potential loss than stocks.
4. Call options have a greater potential profit than stocks, and potential loss is zero.
3. Call options have a greater potential profit and smaller potential loss than stocks.

First Strategy for involving an investment in the stock or to buy 200 shares that is $5,800$29=200 shares.
Another option is to involving investment in the options that is to buy 2000 options

Suppose the share price increased the second strategy will give opportunity to gain greater gain.
Example: Suppose share price rises to $ 35, the following will be result,
Second option: 2,000x($35−$30)−$5,800=$4,200
And from first option: 200x($35−$29)=$1,200 the earning less than the second option.
Suppose the share price goes less, the second strategy will be seen under losses
Example: If the share price goes down to $ 25

Result from first option: 200x($29−$25)=$800, where as the second strategy leads to loss of the entire $ 5,800investment.

10. Which of the following correctly represents the payoff formulas for a long put option and a short forward contract, respectively? Let S_T be the stock price at maturity, and K be the strike price.
1. put: max(K - S_T, 0) & short forward: K - S_T
2. put: max(S_T - K, 0) & short forward: S_T - K
3. put: S_T - K & short forward: max(S_T - K, 0)
4. There is no correct answer.
5. put: K - S_T & short forward: max(K - S_T, 0)
1. put: max(K - S_T, 0) & short forward: K - S_T

설명:
- 롱 풋 옵션(Long Put Option)의 페이오프는 실행 가격(K)에서 만기 시의 주식 가격(S_T)을 뺀 값이 0보다 클 경우 그 차액, 아니면 0입니다. 이는 풋 옵션 구매자가 주식 가격이 하락할 것으로 예상할 때 이익을 얻기 위해 사용하는 전략입니다. 따라서 올바른 공식은 max(K - S_T, 0)입니다.
- 숏 포워드 계약(Short Forward Contract)의 페이오프는 고정된 실행 가격(K)에서 만기 시의 주식 가격(S_T)을 뺀 값입니다. 이는 포워드 계약의 매도자가 미래에 특정 자산을 약정된 가격으로 팔기로 한 계약이므로, S_T가 K보다 낮을 경우 이익을 얻게 되고, S_T가 K보다 높을 경우 손실을 보게 됩니다. 올바른 공식은 K - S_T입니다.

13. Suppose that the USD/sterling spot and 180-day forward exchange rates are 1.2580 and 1.2518, respectively. A 180-day European call option to buy a sterling for $1.22 costs $0.03. What kind of arbitrage trading is possible? Ignore the time value of the money.
1. No arbitrage opportunity
2. Buy the sterling spot and buy the call option
3. Sell the call option and buy sterling forward
4. Buy the call option and sell sterling forward
4. Buy the call option and sell sterling forward

Explanation:
To determine if there is an arbitrage opportunity, let's analyze the given data:

- Spot exchange rate (S): 1.2580 USD/GBP
- 180-day forward exchange rate (F): 1.2518 USD/GBP
- Strike price of the call option (K): 1.22 USD/GBP
- Cost of the call option (premium, C): 0.03 USD

The strategy involves buying a call option and selling sterling forward to potentially lock in a risk-free profit.

1. **Buy the call option:**
   - The call option gives you the right to buy GBP at 1.22 USD in 180 days.
   - Cost of the call option: 0.03 USD.

2. **Sell sterling forward at the forward rate:**
   - You can sell GBP at 1.2518 USD in 180 days.

In 180 days:
- If the spot rate is above 1.22 USD/GBP, you exercise the call option and buy GBP at 1.22 USD.
- You then sell the GBP at the forward rate of 1.2518 USD.
- Profit per GBP = Forward rate - Strike price - Call option premium = 1.2518 - 1.22 - 0.03 = 0.0018 USD.

Since there is a positive difference (0.0018 USD), this strategy creates a risk-free arbitrage opportunity.

Therefore, the correct arbitrage trading strategy is to buy the call option and sell sterling forward.

14. A mining company's stock is listed on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock price is $40 (USD) on the NYSE and $53 (CAD) on the TSE. If the exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.25 CAD, what is the potential arbitrage opportunity?
1. Buy on NYSE, buy on TSE
2. Buy on NYSE, sell on TSE
3. Buy on TSE, sell on NYSE
4. Sell on TSE, sell on NYSE
2. Buy on NYSE, sell on TSE

설명:
- NYSE에서 주식 가격이 $40(USD)이고, TSE에서 주식 가격이 $53(CAD)입니다.
- 환율이 1 USD = 1.25 CAD이므로, NYSE에서 $40(USD)에 구매한 주식은 CAD로 환산하면 $50(CAD)입니다.
- 따라서 NYSE에서 $40(USD)에 주식을 구매하고, TSE에서 $53(CAD)에 팔아 차익을 낼 수 있는 잠재적인 차익거래 기회가 있습니다.

15. The current price of gold is $1,100 per ounce. The forward price for delivery in 6 months is $1,150 per ounce. An arbitrageur has no money but can borrow money at 2% per annum. What should the arbitrageur do?
1. Sell gold now and buy forward for a profit of $50 per ounce.
2. Sell gold now and buy forward for a profit of $39 per ounce.
3. Buy gold now and sell forward for a profit of $39 per ounce.
4. Buy gold now and sell forward for a profit of $50 per ounce.
3. 지금 금을 매수하고 선물로 매도하여 온스당 $39의 이익을 얻는다.

설명:
- 현재 금 가격: $1,100/온스
- 6개월 후 금 선물 가격: $1,150/온스
- 연간 이자율: 2%

6개월 동안의 이자율을 계산하면:
\[2\% \times \frac{6}{12} = 1\% \]

따라서, 현재 금을 $1,100에 매수하고 1%의 이자율로 6개월 동안 대출을 받는다면:
\[$1,100 \times 1.01 = $1,111 \]

6개월 후 금을 $1,150에 매도하면 이익은:
\[$1,150 - $1,111 = $39 \]

따라서, 지금 금을 매수하고 선물로 매도하여 온스당 $39의 이익을 얻을 수 있습니다.

16. Which one of the following is equivalent to the position of a portfolio that includes a long position in a forward contract and a long position in a put option? It is assumed that the expiration date, underlying asset, and exercise price are all the same.
1. Short position in a forward contract
2. Long position in a futures contract with daily settlement
3. Long position in a call option
4. Risk-free bond
3. 롱 포지션을 가진 콜 옵션

설명:
- 선도 계약의 롱 포지션은 미래에 특정 가격으로 자산을 구매할 권리를 제공합니다.
- 풋 옵션의 롱 포지션은 미래에 특정 가격으로 자산을 팔 권리를 제공합니다.
- 이 두 포지션을 결합하면, 사실상 미래에 특정 가격으로 자산을 구매하거나 팔 수 있는 권리가 생깁니다. 이는 콜 옵션의 롱 포지션과 유사한 효과를 제공합니다. 즉, 미래에 특정 가격으로 자산을 구매할 수 있는 권리입니다. 따라서, 선도 계약의 롱 포지션과 풋 옵션의 롱 포지션을 결합하는 것은 콜 옵션의 롱 포지션과 동등한 포지션을 만듭니다.

17. A cattle farmer expects to have 120,000 pounds of live cattle to sell in 3 months. The live cattle futures contract traded by the CME Group is for the delivery of 40,000 pounds of cattle. How can the farmer use the contract for hedging?
1. Take a short position, 3 contracts
2. Take a long position, 4 contracts
3. Take a long position, 3 contracts
4. Take a short position, 4 contracts
1. Take a short position, 3 contracts

Explanation:
- The farmer expects to sell 120,000 pounds of live cattle in 3 months and wants to hedge against the risk of falling prices.
- Since the farmer is going to be a seller of the cattle, he should take a short position in the futures contracts to hedge against price drops.
- Each contract covers 40,000 pounds of cattle. To hedge 120,000 pounds, the farmer needs:
\[\frac{120,000 \text{ pounds}}{40,000 \text{ pounds/contract}} = 3 \text{ contracts} \]
- Therefore, the farmer should take a short position in 3 live cattle futures contracts to hedge against the risk of price decrease.

18. Suppose that there are no storage costs for crude oil, and the interest rate for borrowing or lending is always 4% per annum. How could you make money if the June and December futures contracts for a particular year trade at $50 and $52, respectively?
1. Borrow funds at a risk-free interest rate & go short on June futures & go long on December futures
2. Borrow funds at a risk-free interest rate & go long on June futures & go short on December futures
3. Invest funds at a risk-free interest rate & go long on June futures & go short on December futures
4. Invest funds at a risk-free interest rate & go short on June futures & go long on December futures
5. There is no arbitrage opportunity.
2. Borrow funds at a risk-free interest rate & go long on June futures & go short on December futures

Explanation:
- The June futures price is $50, and the December futures price is $52.
- The interest rate for 6 months is 4% per annum, which corresponds to approximately 2% for 6 months.

To exploit the arbitrage opportunity:
1. Borrow funds at the risk-free interest rate.
2. Go long on the June futures contract at $50.
3. Go short on the December futures contract at $52.

By doing this, you are essentially locking in a guaranteed profit due to the difference in futures prices and the interest rate. The cost of holding the position for 6 months is less than the difference between the two futures prices:
- The cost of borrowing $50 for 6 months at 4% per annum is approximately $1 (2% of $50).
- The profit from the futures position is $2 ($52 - $50).

Therefore, the net arbitrage profit is approximately $1 per barrel.

19. Which statement is true regarding the margin system in futures trading?
1. Margin accounts decrease when taking a long position and futures price increases.
2. Futures traders are not required to deposit margin.
3. Margin accounts decrease when taking a short position and futures price increases.
4. Margin accounts remain the same regardless of the futures price.
3. Margin accounts decrease when taking a short position and futures price increases.

Explanation:
- In futures trading, traders are required to deposit a certain amount of funds into a margin account as a guarantee of their ability to fulfill the contract. This is known as the initial margin.
- When a trader takes a short position, they are betting that the price of the underlying asset will decrease. If the futures price increases instead, the value of the position decreases, leading to a loss for the trader. To maintain the margin account at the required maintenance margin level, the trader may need to deposit additional funds into the margin account. Therefore, the margin account decreases when taking a short position and the futures price increases. 

---

20. Suppose that you enter into a short futures contract to sell August gold for $1,750 per ounce. The size of the contract is 100 ounces. The initial margin is $5,000, and the maintenance margin is $4,000. What change in the futures price will lead to a margin call?
1. A $10 increase in the futures price.
2. A $10 decrease in the futures price.
3. A $5 decrease in the futures price.
4. A $5 increase in the futures price.
1. A $10 increase in the futures price.

Explanation:
When you enter into a short futures contract, you agree to sell an asset at a specified price in the future. If the futures price increases, it means your potential loss on the contract increases, which can lead to a margin call if the equity in your margin account falls below the maintenance margin.

The initial margin is $5,000, and the maintenance margin is $4,000. The contract size is 100 ounces. 

A $10 increase in the futures price means a loss of:
\[$10 \times 100 \text{ ounces} = $1,000 \]

This $1,000 loss would reduce the equity in your margin account. If the account's value falls below the maintenance margin ($4,000), you would receive a margin call. Since the initial margin is $5,000, a loss of $1,000 due to a $10 increase in the futures price would bring the account's value to $4,000, exactly at the maintenance margin threshold. Therefore, any increase beyond this $10 would trigger a margin call to bring the account back up to the initial margin level.

# 21~30

21. A trader buys three August futures contracts on crude oil. Each contract is for the delivery of 1,000 barrels. The current futures price is $70 per barrel, the initial margin is $4,000 per contract, and the maintenance margin is $3,000 per contract. Under what circumstances could $3,000 be withdrawn from the margin account?
1. When the futures price decreases to $69 per barrel
2. When the trader sells one of the futures contracts
3. When the trader buys three more futures contracts
4. When the futures price increases to $71 per barrel
4. 선물 가격이 배럴당 $71로 상승할 때

Explanation:
선물 계약을 매수하면 선물 가격이 상승할 때 이익을 얻고, 하락할 때 손실을 입게 됩니다. 현재 선물 가격이 배럴당 $70이고, 초기 마진은 계약당 $4,000, 유지 마진은 계약당 $3,000입니다. 트레이더는 세 개의 계약을 매수했으므로 총 초기 마진은 $12,000입니다.

각 계약은 1,000 배럴이고, 선물 가격이 배럴당 $1 상승하면 트레이더는 계약당 $1,000의 이익을 얻습니다. 트레이더가 세 개의 계약을 보유하고 있으므로, 선물 가격이 배럴당 $1 상승하면 총 $3,000의 이익을 얻게 됩니다.

따라서, 선물 가격이 배럴당 $71로 상승하면 트레이더는 $3,000의 이익을 얻고, 이 금액을 마진 계정에서 인출할 수 있습니다.

22. A clearing house member is long 50 contracts with an initial margin of $1,500 per contract. On the following day, the member becomes responsible for clearing an additional 10 long contracts, entered into at a price of $1,550 per contract. The settlement price at the end of this day is $1,525. How much does the member have to add to its margin account with the exchange clearing house?
1. The member needs to add $1,000 any additional margin.
2. **The member needs to add $14,000 to its margin account.**
3. The member needs to add $1,250 to its margin account.
4. The member needs to add $15,000 to its margin account.

10개의 롱을 추가로 쳤으므로 이니셜마진이 10 * 1500 = 15000만큼 필요하다.
추가로 롱을 칠 때 가격이 1550이었다. 1525로 떨어졌으니, 10 * 25 = 250만큼 손실이 났다.
이전에 쳤던 1500의 50개 롱컨트랙들에서 25만큼 가격이 올랐으니 50* 25 = 1250만큼 이득이 났다.
따라서 15000 - 1250 + 250 = 14000만큼 추가해야 한다.

23. Which statement is true about the difference between futures and forward contracts?
1. Futures contracts are settled at the end of the maturity, while forward contracts are settled daily.
2. Futures contracts are traded on OTC, while forward contracts are traded on CCP.
3. Futures contracts have a fixed price, while forward contracts have a price determined at the maturity.
4. If there are significant price fluctuations before the maturity date, futures contracts can lead to more unfavorable results compared to forward contracts.
4. 만기일 이전에 가격 변동이 큰 경우, 선물 계약은 선도 계약에 비해 더 불리한 결과를 초래할 수 있습니다.

설명:
선물 계약과 선도 계약의 주요 차이점은 다음과 같습니다:

1. **결제 방식:** 선물 계약은 일일 정산(daily settlement) 시스템을 사용하여 매일 증거금 계좌가 조정됩니다. 반면, 선도 계약은 만기일에 한 번 정산됩니다.
2. **거래 장소:** 선물 계약은 거래소에서 표준화된 형태로 거래되며, 선도 계약은 장외(OTC) 시장에서 거래됩니다.
3. **가격 결정:** 선물 계약과 선도 계약 모두 계약 체결 시점에 가격이 결정됩니다. 하지만 선물 계약은 일일 정산으로 인해 중간에 가격 변동에 따른 현금 흐름이 발생합니다.
4. **위험:** 선물 계약은 일일 정산으로 인해 가격 변동성이 클 경우 일일 마진 콜(margin call)을 통해 추가 자금을 요구받을 수 있습니다. 이는 선도 계약에 비해 더 불리한 결과를 초래할 수 있습니다.

따라서 4번이 선물 계약과 선도 계약의 차이에 대해 가장 정확한 설명을 제공합니다.

24. Which of the following statements about changes in the OTC market since the 2008 financial crisis is false?
1. Collateral requirements have increased.
2. Central counterparties have been introduced to ease the surveillance of the authorities' regulations on OTC markets and to ensure the freedom of the market.
3. Regulations have been introduced to reduce counterparty risk.
4. Participants in the OTC market are now required to report their transactions to the CCP.

2...

설명:
OTC 시장에서의 거래는 전통적으로 중앙청산소를 통하지 않고 직접적으로 거래 양 당사자 간에 이루어집니다. 2008년 금융 위기 이후, OTC 파생상품 시장에 대한 규제가 강화되었으며, 이는 참가자들이 특정 거래 정보를 규제 기관에 보고하도록 요구하는 것을 포함합니다. 그러나 모든 OTC 거래가 중앙청산소(CCP)를 통해 보고되어야 한다는 것은 아닙니다. 대신, 일부 파생상품 거래는 중앙청산소를 통해 청산될 수 있으며, 이는 시장의 투명성을 높이고 대규모 파산 시 시스템적 위험을 줄이는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 그러나 이는 모든 OTC 거래에 적용되는 것은 아니며, 보고 요구 사항은 주로 규제 기관과의 관계에 관한 것입니다. 따라서 4번 진술은 잘못되었습니다.

25. Which of the following scenarios does not result in a change in open interest?
1. A new buyer enters the market and purchases a contract from a seller who was already holding a contract.
2. All scenarios result in a change in open interest.
3. A holder of a futures contract sells the contract to a buyer who wants to close out her position.
4. An existing buyer and seller agree to offset their positions by entering into an opposite trade.
1. A new buyer enters the market and purchases a contract from a seller who was already holding a contract.

Explanation:
Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding contracts that are held by market participants at the end of the trading day. It is a measure of market activity and liquidity. Open interest increases when a new contract is created (i.e., a new buyer and a new seller enter the market) and decreases when a contract is closed (i.e., an existing buyer and an existing seller offset their positions).

Let's analyze the scenarios:

1. **A new buyer enters the market and purchases a contract from a seller who was already holding a contract.**
   - In this case, the new buyer takes over the existing contract from the seller. The total number of outstanding contracts remains unchanged because the contract is simply transferred from one party to another. Therefore, there is no change in open interest.

2. **All scenarios result in a change in open interest.**
   - This statement is incorrect because, as we can see from scenario 1, not all scenarios result in a change in open interest.

3. **A holder of a futures contract sells the contract to a buyer who wants to close out her position.**
   - This scenario involves one party closing out their position by selling to someone who also wants to close out their position. This results in a reduction in open interest because two positions are being closed.

4. **An existing buyer and seller agree to offset their positions by entering into an opposite trade.**
   - When an existing buyer and seller offset their positions, it reduces the number of outstanding contracts, thereby decreasing open interest.

Therefore, the correct answer is 1. A new buyer enters the market and purchases a contract from a seller who was already holding a contract. This scenario does not result in a change in open interest.

26. On a particular day, there were 1,500 trades in a particular futures contract. This means that there were 1,500 buyers (going long) and 1,500 sellers (going short). Of the 1,500 buyers, 900 were closing out positions, and 600 were entering into new positions. Of the 1,500 sellers, 1,200 were closing out positions, and 300 were entering into new positions. What is the impact of the day's trading on open interest?
1. The open interest increased by 600.
2. The open interest decreased by 300.
3. The open interest increased by 300.
4. **The open interest decreased by 600.**

선물 계약의 오픈 이자(Open Interest)는 시장에서 열려 있는 계약의 수를 나타내며, 신규 포지션이 추가되거나 기존 포지션이 청산될 때 변동합니다.

주어진 정보:
- 총 거래 수: 1,500 (1,500명의 구매자와 1,500명의 판매자)
- 1,500명의 구매자 중 900명은 포지션을 청산했고, 600명은 신규 포지션을 개설했다.
- 1,500명의 판매자 중 1,200명은 포지션을 청산했고, 300명은 신규 포지션을 개설했다.

오픈 이자의 변화는 신규 포지션의 수와 청산된 포지션의 수로 결정됩니다.

1. 신규 구매자: 600명
2. 신규 판매자: 300명
3. 포지션을 청산한 구매자: 900명
4. 포지션을 청산한 판매자: 1,200명

신규 포지션:
- 신규 구매자 600명과 신규 판매자 300명은 각각 새로운 포지션을 개설한 것입니다. 따라서, 
\[신규 포지션 = \min(600, 300) = 300 \]

청산된 포지션:
- 포지션을 청산한 구매자 900명과 포지션을 청산한 판매자 1,200명은 각각 기존 포지션을 닫은 것입니다. 따라서,
\[청산된 포지션 = \min(900, 1,200) = 900 \]

오픈 이자의 변화:
\[ 오픈 이자의 변화 = 신규 포지션 - 청산된 포지션 = 300 - 900 = -600 \]

따라서, 오픈 이자는 600만큼 감소했습니다.

정답은:
\[ 4. 오픈 이자는 600만큼 감소했습니다. \]

27. What position is equivalent to a long forward contract to buy an asset at K on a certain date and a short position of a call option to buy it for K on that date?
1. Long Call
2. Short Put
3. Long Put
4. Short Call
5. There is no correct answer.

정답은 2. 숏 풋 (Short Put)입니다.

설명:
- 롱 포워드 계약은 미래의 특정 날짜에 자산을 K 가격에 구매할 의무를 가지는 포지션입니다.
- 숏 콜 옵션은 미래의 특정 날짜에 자산을 K 가격에 살 수 있는 권리를 판매한 포지션입니다.

이 두 가지 포지션을 결합하면, 실제로 자산을 K 가격에 구매하는 것과 동일한 효과를 갖게 됩니다. 이는 숏 풋 옵션과 동일합니다. 숏 풋 옵션은 미래의 특정 날짜에 자산을 K 가격에 팔 의무를 가지는 포지션입니다. 따라서, 롱 포워드 계약과 숏 콜 옵션을 결합하면 숏 풋 옵션과 동일한 포지션이 됩니다.

28. Japanese companies that receive US dollars and export are considering forward exchange hedging strategies for exchange rate fluctuations. Which of the following is the correct forward exchange strategy?
1. Sell yen futures.
2. Buy yen put-options.
3. Sell dollar futures.
4. Buy dollar futures.

일본 회사가 미국 달러를 받고 수출을 한다면, 환율 변동 위험을 헤지하기 위한 전략으로는 미래에 자신들이 받을 달러를 일정 환율로 엔화로 바꿀 수 있도록 해야 합니다. 이 경우, 적절한 전략은 다음과 같습니다:

3. Sell dollar futures.

이는 회사가 미래에 미국 달러를 팔고 엔화를 구매하기로 미리 계약하는 것과 같습니다. 달러 선물을 판매함으로써, 회사는 미래에 특정한 환율로 달러를 엔화로 교환할 수 있는 권리를 얻게 됩니다. 이것은 환율 변동으로 인한 위험을 줄이는 데 도움이 됩니다.

29. A person who holds the spot has done a short futures hedge. What is the amount received at maturity?
1. Maturity futures price + basis
2. Initial spot price - basis
3. Initial spot price + basis
4. Initial futures price + basis

선물 헤지를 이해하기 위해서는 현물 포지션과 선물 포지션의 관계를 고려해야 합니다. 다음은 단기 선물 헤지를 했을 때 만기 시점에 받는 금액을 계산하는 방법입니다:

단기 선물 헤지를 하는 경우, 현물 포지션의 가격 변동을 선물 포지션의 반대 방향으로 헤지하여 전체적인 손익을 중립화하려는 전략입니다. 만기 시점에 받는 금액은 다음과 같습니다:

1. 현물 가격 + (초기 선물 가격 - 만기 선물 가격)

이 식은 선물 계약을 통해 현물 포지션의 가격 변동을 상쇄하는 방식입니다. 이를 고려하면 올바른 답은 다음과 같습니다:

4. Initial futures price + basis

29. A company needs to sell 8000 barrels of crude oil in November. It uses the December CME Group futures contract to hedge the price it will pay. Each contract is for 1000 barrels of "light sweet crude". What position should it take?
1. Long 9 contracts
2. Long 8 contracts
3. Short 8 contracts
4. Short 9 contracts

A company looking to hedge against the potential decrease in the price of crude oil it needs to sell in November can do so by taking a position in futures contracts that would gain value if the price of crude oil were to decrease, thereby offsetting the loss in value of the physical crude oil it plans to sell.

Since the company plans to sell 8000 barrels of crude oil, and each CME Group futures contract for "light sweet crude" is for 1000 barrels, the company would need to hedge with the equivalent amount of barrels in futures contracts, which is 8 contracts in this case.

To hedge against a decrease in price, the company should take a short position in the futures contracts. This means the company agrees to sell futures contracts at the current price, anticipating that the price will decrease in the future. When they actually sell their physical crude oil in November, if the price has indeed decreased, the gain from the futures contracts will offset the loss from the lower sale price of the physical oil.

Therefore, the correct position for the company to take is:

3. Short 8 contracts

31. When does minimum variance hedge have no hedge effect at all?
1. There is no correct answer.
2. When the correlation coefficient between the futures price and the hedged asset price is -1.
3. When the correlation coefficient between the futures price and the hedged asset price is zero.
4. Minimum variance hedge always provides a perfect hedge effect.
5. When the correlation coefficient between the futures price and the hedged asset price is 1.

최소 분산 헤지가 효과가 없을 때는 선물 가격과 헤지하는 자산 가격 간의 상관 계수가 0일 때입니다. 상관 계수가 0이면 두 가격 간에 아무런 관계가 없다는 의미이므로, 선물 계약을 통해 헤지 효과를 얻을 수 없습니다.

따라서 정답은:

3. 선물 가격과 헤지하는 자산 가격 간의 상관 계수가 0일 때.

32. Suppose that the standard deviation of monthly changes in the prices of a commodity is $0.75, the standard deviation of monthly changes in a futures price on another commodity is $0.95, and the coefficient of correlation between the two changes is 0.6. What is the optimal hedge ratio for hedging the price of the commodity in a month, using the futures contract?
1. 0.545
2. 0.579
3. 0.474
4. 0.441

최적 헤지 비율(Optimal Hedge Ratio)을 구하기 위해서는 다음 공식을 사용합니다:

\[h^* = \rho \frac{\sigma_S}{\sigma_F} \]

여기서:
- \(h^* \)는 최적 헤지 비율
- \(\rho \)는 두 자산 간의 상관 계수
- \(\sigma_S \)는 현물 가격의 표준 편차
- \(\sigma_F \)는 선물 가격의 표준 편차

주어진 값을 대입하면,
- \(\rho = 0.6 \)
- \(\sigma_S = 0.75 \)
- \(\sigma_F = 0.95 \)

공식에 대입해 봅시다:

\[h^* = 0.6 \times \frac{0.75}{0.95} \]

계산하면,

\[h^* = 0.6 \times 0.7895 = 0.4737 \]

이를 반올림하면 0.474가 됩니다.

따라서 최적 헤지 비율은:

3. 0.474

33. The monthly standard deviation of crude oil spot price (cents per pound) is 1.5. The monthly standard deviation of crude oil futures price for the nearest contract is 1.8. The correlation between changes in futures price and changes in spot price is 0.6. Each contract is for delivery of 5,000 pounds of cattle. Someone plans to buy 150,000 pounds of crude oil. How many long or short positions in futures contracts should be taken?
1. Short position on 7 contracts
2. Short position on 15 contracts
3. Long position on 7 contracts
4. Long position on 15 contracts

To determine the number of futures contracts needed to hedge a position, we first calculate the optimal hedge ratio, and then use it to find the number of contracts. The optimal hedge ratio (h*) is given by the formula:

\[h^* = \rho \frac{\sigma_S}{\sigma_F} \]

where:
- \(\rho \) is the correlation coefficient between the futures price and the spot price changes,
- \(\sigma_S \) is the standard deviation of the spot price changes,
- \(\sigma_F \) is the standard deviation of the futures price changes.

Given:
- \(\rho = 0.6 \),
- \(\sigma_S = 1.5 \),
- \(\sigma_F = 1.8 \).

Plugging the numbers into the formula gives:

\[h^* = 0.6 \times \frac{1.5}{1.8} = 0.6 \times 0.8333 = 0.5 \]

The optimal hedge ratio is 0.5. 

Next, we determine the size of the position that needs to be hedged in terms of futures contracts. The person plans to buy 150,000 pounds of crude oil. Each futures contract is for the delivery of 5,000 pounds of crude oil.

\[\text{Total contracts needed} = \frac{\text{Total pounds}}{\text{Pounds per contract}} = \frac{150,000}{5,000} = 30 \text{ contracts} \]

To hedge, we use the optimal hedge ratio:

\[\text{Number of contracts to hedge} = 30 \times 0.5 = 15 \]

Since the person plans to buy crude oil, they should take a long position in futures contracts to hedge against the risk of rising prices.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

4. Long position on 15 contracts.

34. The company wants to hedge its exposure to new-metal futures price fluctuations. The price fluctuation of this new-metal has a correlation of 0.5 with a ordinary metal futures price fluctuations. The company incurs a loss of $1 million if the price of this new-metal increases by $1. The standard deviation of the new-metal futures price change is 80% greater than the standard deviation of ordinary metal futures price changes. Each futures contract corresponds to 0.03 million ordinary metals. How much futures contract should be contracted?
1. **Long 3000 contracts**
2. Short 3000 contracts
3. Short 2000 contracts
4. Long 2000 contracts

표준편차 비율은 뉴메탈/원래메탈 = 1.8
최적헷지비율은 1.8 * 0.5 = 0.9
0.01달러 가격올랐을 때 1M만큼 손해를 본다면 100M만큼의 미래 매수 포지션
선물계약당 0.03M이므로,
최적계약수 = 0.9 * 100M / 0.03M = 3000

35. The company has a portfolio of 15 million dollars with a beta of 1.5. They are looking to hedge their risk using stock index futures contracts. The current index futures price is at 1100, with each contract representing 200 times the index. What should they do to decrease the portfolio's beta to 1.0? (approximate value)
1. Sell 34 futures contracts
2. Buy 56 futures contracts
3. Sell 56 futures contracts
4. Buy 34 futures contracts

포트폴리오의 베타를 감소시키려면, 그 차이에 해당하는 양만큼의 선물 계약을 취해야 합니다. 포트폴리오의 현재 베타는 1.5이고, 목표 베타는 1.0입니다. 이를 위해 우리는 다음 계산을 사용합니다:

\[\Delta\beta = \beta_{현재} - \beta_{목표} \]

\[\Delta\beta = 1.5 - 1.0 = 0.5 \]

포트폴리오의 가치를 감안할 때, 우리는 이 베타 차이를 조정하기 위해 얼마나 많은 선물 계약이 필요한지 계산할 수 있습니다. 선물 계약을 사용하여 베타를 조정하는 공식은 다음과 같습니다:

\[\text{필요한 선물 계약 수} = \frac{\Delta\beta \times \text{포트폴리오 가치}}{\text{선물 계약당 가치}} \]

선물 계약당 가치는 인덱스의 값에 계약 멀티플라이어를 곱한 것입니다. 여기서 인덱스는 1100이고, 각 선물 계약은 인덱스의 200배를 대표합니다. 따라서 선물 계약당 가치는:

\[1100 \times 200 = 220,000 \]

이제 필요한 선물 계약 수를 계산할 수 있습니다:

\[\frac{0.5 \times 15,000,000}{220,000} = \frac{7,500,000}{220,000} \approx 34.09 \]

이 결과는 포트폴리오의 베타를 1.5에서 1.0으로 감소시키기 위해 약 34개의 선물 계약을 매도해야 함을 나타냅니다. 따라서 올바른 답은:

1. Sell 34 futures contracts

36. The expected return of the S&P 500 is 10%, and the risk-free interest rate is 3%. What is the expected return for an investment with a beta of 0.4? Use CAPM
1. 0.043
2. 0.048
3. 0.053
4. 0.058

CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model, 자본 자산 가격 모델)을 사용하여 기대 수익률을 계산할 수 있습니다. CAPM 공식은 다음과 같습니다:

\[\text{Expected Return} = R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f) \]

여기서:
- \(R_f \)는 무위험 이자율 (risk-free rate)입니다.
- \(\beta \)는 자산의 베타 값입니다.
- \(R_m \)는 시장의 기대 수익률 (expected return of the market)입니다.

주어진 값들을 대입하면:
- \(R_f = 0.03 \) (3%)
- \(\beta = 0.4 \)
- \(R_m = 0.10 \) (10%)

공식에 대입하면:
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.03 + 0.4 (0.10 - 0.03) \]
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.03 + 0.4 \times 0.07 \]
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.03 + 0.028 \]
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.058 \]

따라서, 기대 수익률은 5.8%입니다. 정답은:

4. 0.058

37. A portfolio manager has maintained an actively managed portfolio with a beta of 0.8. During the last year, the risk-free rate was 3%, and equities performed very well, providing a return of 25%. The portfolio manager produced a return of 23% and claims that, in the circumstances, it was a good performance. Discuss this claim.
1. Cannot evaluate.
2. Did better than expected.
3. Did worse than expected.
4. Did as well as expected.

포트폴리오 매니저의 주장이 타당한지 평가하기 위해, 포트폴리오의 기대 수익률을 CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)을 사용하여 계산해 보겠습니다. CAPM 공식은 다음과 같습니다:

\[\text{Expected Return} = R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f) \]

주어진 값들을 대입하면:
- \(R_f = 0.03 \) (3%)
- \(\beta = 0.8 \)
- \(R_m = 0.25 \) (25%)

포트폴리오의 기대 수익률은 다음과 같이 계산됩니다:
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.03 + 0.8 (0.25 - 0.03) \]
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.03 + 0.8 \times 0.22 \]
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.03 + 0.176 \]
\[\text{Expected Return} = 0.206 \]

즉, 기대 수익률은 20.6%입니다. 포트폴리오 매니저는 실제로 23%의 수익률을 올렸습니다. 이는 기대 수익률인 20.6%를 초과한 성과입니다.

따라서, 포트폴리오 매니저는 기대 수익률보다 더 나은 성과를 올렸다고 할 수 있습니다. 정답은:

2. Did better than expected.

38. It is on July 16. A company has a portfolio of stocks worth $100 million. The beta of the portfolio is 1.2. The company would like to use the December futures contract on a stock index to change the beta of the portfolio to 0.8 during the period from July 16 to November 16. The index futures price is currently 2,300, and each contract is $250 times the index. What position in futures contracts should it take? (Approximate value)
1. Purchase of 70 contracts
2. Purchase of 57 contracts
3. Sell of 57 contracts
4. Sell of 70 contracts

먼저, 포트폴리오의 베타를 1.2에서 0.8로 줄이기 위해 필요한 선물 계약 수를 계산해야 합니다. 이를 위해 다음 공식을 사용합니다:

\[\text{Number of contracts} = \frac{(\beta_{\text{target}} - \beta_{\text{current}}) \times \text{Portfolio value}}{\text{Contract size} \times \text{Futures price}} \]

주어진 값을 대입하면:
- \(\beta_{\text{current}} = 1.2\)
- \(\beta_{\text{target}} = 0.8\)
- \(\text{Portfolio value} = 100,000,000\) 달러
- \(\text{Futures price} = 2,300\)
- \(\text{Contract size} = 250\) (지수의 배수)

공식에 대입하면:
\[\text{Number of contracts} = \frac{(0.8 - 1.2) \times 100,000,000}{250 \times 2,300} \]
\[\text{Number of contracts} = \frac{-0.4 \times 100,000,000}{575,000} \]
\[\text{Number of contracts} = \frac{-40,000,000}{575,000} \]
\[\text{Number of contracts} = -69.57 \]

따라서, 약 70개의 선물 계약을 매도해야 합니다. 정답은:

4. Sell of 70 contracts

A financial institution has entered into an interest rate swap with company X. Under the terms of the swap, it receives 3.7% per annum and pays LIBOR on a principal of $10 million for three years. Payments are made every year. Suppose that company X defaults on the second payment date (end of year 2) when 1-year forward LIBOR rates for all maturities are 3.2% per annum. What is the loss to the financial institution? Assume that 1-year LIBOR was 3% per annum through year 2 and that at the time of the default, all OIS rates were 2.3% per annum. OIS rates are expressed with continuous compounding; other rates are expressed with annual compounding.

Suppose a company take long forward contracts or long futures contracts for hedging currency risk. Consider whether the company is better off using a futures contract or a forward contract given condition:

1. If the exchange rate drops sharply at the beginning, the initial loss is evaluated lower, making futures contracts more advantageous.

2. If the exchange rate falls at the beginning and returns to the original point at maturity, the initial loss is evaluated lower at maturity, making futures contracts advantageous.

3. **If the exchange rate rises at the beginning and returns to the original point at maturity, the initial gain is evaluated higher, making futures contracts more advantageous.**

4. If the exchange rate rises sharply at the beginning, the initial gain is evaluated lower, making futures contracts more advantageous.

Calculate the maximum range within which the new event price K* must satisfy in the following situation. The company signed a contract to sell foreign currency to a bank at a rate of 1.2 in three months time at the end of March. The actual exchange rate at the end of March was 1.5. Instead of extending the contract's maturity for another three months until the end of June, the company proposed a new event price K* that is advantageous to the bank. Domestic interest rates are 0.01 and foreign interest rates are 0.012, both on an annual basis and continuously compounded.

1. **K* must be lower than 1.1984.**

2. K* must be higher than 1.1984.

3. K* must be lower than 1.1566.

4. K* must be higher than 1.1566.

계약 미루는 것 거부할 경우

은행의 확정손익 $S_{1}-K_{1}$

계약을 미루는 대신 행사가격 바꿀 경우

은행은 계약가치가 $S_{1}-K_{1}$ 이상이도록 행사가격을 정한다. 즉,

$$ S_{1}-K_{1} \leq S_{1}e^{-r_{f}(T_{2}-T_{1})} - K_{2}e^{-r(T_{2}-T_{1})} $$

만약 당장 롱포지션을 행사한다면 $S_{1}$만큼의 외환을 보유하여 외국이자율로 투자하므로 할인율이 외국이자율이고,

행사가격은 국내자금으로 지급되므로 할인율이 국내이자율

위 식을 정리하면

$$ K_{2} \leq S_{1}e^{(r-r_{f})(T_{2}-T_{1})} -(S_{1}-K_{1})e^{r(T_{2}-T_{1})} $$

숫자 대입하면 $K_2 ≤ 1.1984$

If companies X and Y borrow in Korean won, they have to pay interest rates of 9.7% and 8.3%, respectively. Also, if X and Y borrow in US dollars, they have to pay interest rates of 10.3% and 9.5%, respectively. X wants to borrow in Korean won, and Y wants to borrow in US dollars. If the swap intermediary bank charges a commission of 0.1%, how much profit will X and Y make when they have the same swap-profit? What is the total gain to all three parties?

1. X: 0.15%, Y: 0.15%, Profit from Swap: 0.4%

2. X: 0.15%, Y: 0.15%, Profit from Swap: 0.3%

3. **X: 0.25%, Y: 0.25%, Profit from Swap: 0.6%**

4. X: 0.25%, Y: 0.25%, Profit from Swap: 0.5%

Y의 원화 절대우위 1.4% - 달러화 절대우위 0.8% = 0.6%가 스왑의 총이득

중개은행이 0.1%를 가져가므로 0.5%를 X와 Y가 나눠가지면 0.25%씩 얻는다.

스왑 디자인 점검

X는 비교우위 달러화로 10.3%에 차입, 스왑에서 달러화 10.3% 수취, 원화 9.45% 차입

→ 원화 차입에서 0.25% 이득

Y는 비교우위 원화로 8.3%에 차입, 스왑에서 원화 8.3% 수취, 달러화 9.25% 차입

→ 달러화 차입에서 0.25% 이득

스왑은행은 달러화에서 1.05% 손해, 원화에서 1.15% 이득이므로 총 0.1% 이득

A financial institution has entered into a 2-year currency swap with company Y. Under the terms of the swap, the financial institution receives interest at 2% per annum in Swiss francs and pays interest at 6.5% per annum in U.S. dollars. Interest payments are exchanged semiannually. The principal amounts are 7 million dollars and 10 million francs. Suppose that company Y declares bankruptcy at the end of year 1, when the exchange rate is $0.85 per franc. What is the cost to the financial institution? Assume that, at the end of year 1, risk-free interest rates are 4% per annum in Swiss francs and 8% per annum in U.S. dollars for all maturities. The risk-free interest rates are based on annual compounding, while other interest rates are quoted with semiannual compounding.

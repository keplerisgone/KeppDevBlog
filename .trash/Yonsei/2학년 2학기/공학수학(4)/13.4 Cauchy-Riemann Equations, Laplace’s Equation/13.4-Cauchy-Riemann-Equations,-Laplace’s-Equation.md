## Laplace’s equation

if the complex function $f(z)$﻿ is analytic in $D$﻿, then $u$﻿ and $v$﻿ in $f(z)$﻿ satisfy Laplace’s equation,

> $\nabla^2u=u_{xx}+u_{yy}=0 \\ \nabla^2v=v_{xx}+v_{yy}=0$﻿

proof is here

and if $u,v$﻿ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equation, then they are called harmnic conjugates.

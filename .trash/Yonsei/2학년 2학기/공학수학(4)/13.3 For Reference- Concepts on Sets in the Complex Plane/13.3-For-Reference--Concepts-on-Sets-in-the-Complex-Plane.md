- open set : a set that doesn’t contains its boundary points
    - boundary points : if $p$﻿ is a set of $S \subset \mathbb{R},$﻿ and for any $\delta>0$﻿, $(p-\delta,p+\delta)$﻿ contains a ponte outside from $S$﻿. $p$﻿ is called a boundary point.

        if every boundary points $\in S$﻿, $S$﻿ said to be closed.
        
- close set : a set that contains its boundary points

+) half open or half closed

- disconnected : if we can cover two different sets by disjoint open sets, it’s called disconnected.

- unit circle : $|z-a|=\rho$﻿
- open circular disk : $|z-a|<\rho$﻿ = neighborhood of a
- closed circular disk : $|z-a| \le \rho$﻿
- open annulus : $\rho_1 < |z-a|< \rho_2$﻿
    - ..or $0 < |z-a| < \rho_2$﻿
- closed annulus : $\rho_1 \le |z-a| \le \rho_2$﻿

- half-planes : $y>0$﻿ or $y<0$﻿

## Complex Function

## Limit, Continuity

defined by a disk, function $f(z)$﻿ has limits at $z_0$﻿ only when its limit has the same value for any direction to $z_0$﻿.

if the value of the point and limit are same, the function $f(z)$﻿ is said to be continuous at $z=z_0$﻿.

요약) 평범한 미분과 같은데다가 미분 법칙도 모두 성립한다

근데 $\bar{z}$﻿만 안 그렇다

- analyticity : a function $f(z)$﻿ is said to be analytic in a domain $D$﻿ if the function is differentiable at all points of $D$﻿.
- polynomials, Rational functions
    
    $c_0 + c_1z+c_2z^2...$﻿ and $g(z)/h(z) $﻿ ($g,h$﻿ are the polynomials)

## Complex numbers

> $z = (x,y)$﻿

- pair of real numbers $x,y$﻿

- $x$﻿ : real part
- $y$﻿ : imaginary part

## Notation, Multiplication, Notation z = x + iy

- Addtion

It’s true for pure real numbers ($(x_1, 0), (x_2,0)$﻿), so complex numbers extend the real numbers.

- Notation
    
    > $z =x+iy$﻿, $i^2 = -1$﻿

## Complex Conjugate Numbers

- complex conjugate $\bar{z}$﻿ of a complex number $z = x+iy$﻿
    
    ![[Screenshot_2023-11-02_at_10.21.19_PM.png]]
    
    it’s obtained by reflecting the point of $ z$﻿ in the real axis

real part and imaginary part of complex number can be obtained by calculating with conjugated and original form.

some rules are here.

## Complex Plane

real axis + imaginary axis = complex plane
